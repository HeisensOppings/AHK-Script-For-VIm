# AHK Script for Vim

This is an AutoHotkey (AHK) script inspired by Vim, designed for Windows. Note that it does not fully replicate Vim's functionality but serves as a reference.

## How to Use

1. Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
2. Run the script.

To convert the script to an executable, use Ahk2Exe. After conversion, add the executable to:
`C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp` for automatic startup.

### Script Controls
- **Start Script**: Press `CapsLock`
- **End Script**: Press `i` or `o`
